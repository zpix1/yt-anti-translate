# YouTube Anti Translate

Source code of [YouTube Anti Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-anti-translate/ndpmhjnlfkgfalaieeneneenijondgag) Chromium Extension created by [zpix1](https://github.com/zpix1),
And [YouTube Anti Translate - mv3](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/youtube-anti-translate-mv3/) Firefox Extension mantained by [namakeingo](https://github.com/namakeingo).

All the people involved were annoyed by YouTube changing video titles to poorly user-translated versions. While it might be useful if you do not know the language, it quickly becomes annoying once you do.
As there is no option provided by YouTube to disable it, we made this extension to retrieve original titles and change them back.
As YouTube later got even more annoying with translated descriptions, audio (dubbing) and channel branding, the extension was expanded to untranslate that too.

It is much easier to use than its analogues (such as [YoutubeAutotranslateCanceler](https://github.com/pcouy/YoutubeAutotranslateCanceler)), because it does not require any YouTube API keys (for core features) or additional userscript extensions.

## Features

- Restores original video titles on YouTube (Title Anti-Translation)
- Restores original video descriptions on YouTube (can be toggled in settings "Untranslate description")
- Disables automatic audio (dubbing) translation (can be toggled in settings "Untranslate audio track")
- Restores original channel branding header and about on YouTube (can be toggled in settings "Untranslate channel branding")
- Untranslates YouTube Shorts audio and titles
- Works automatically without any configuration

### Enhanced Features Reliability Option

In the extension settings, you can optionally provide a YouTube Data API Key. Although this is optional, it is reccomended.

When that is populated, some features work more reliably.
